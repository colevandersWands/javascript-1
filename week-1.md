# Week 1

you'll be learning the first workings of JavaScript as a language in isolation (the homeworks), experimenting with it in context (the project), and getting serious about GitHub issues & pull requests (assignment submission & feedback).

## Agenda

In class we'll go over the first tastes of JS, but the main point of class will be making sure you know how to complete and submit your homework assignments.  We'll start each assignment together to get you started for the week

### Using GitHub
* create github accounts (if you haven't) - USE YOUR REAL NAME
* what is github, what's it for?
* [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* [pull requesting](https://github.com/janke-learning/pull-requesting) - practicing this with groups of 3 others.  This is the work flow will use to check your homework.

### homework setup
* go over the [class-5 wiki](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBEHomework/class-5/wiki/module-2---JS-1) and how turning in homework will work
* fork the [project](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-cross-module) & [homework](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework) repos and go over how they will be used
* practice turning in homework by forking [this repo](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/first-github-homework) and completing the instructions
      * [no issues? no issue!](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/179468/forking-a-repo-on-github-but-allowing-new-issues-on-the-fork)
      * [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* add your row in the class wiki homework tables



### JS
* [what is it, what's it for](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)

    * [js notional machine](https://github.com/janke-learning/js-notional-machine)
* [chrome inspector](https://javascript.info/debugging-chrome)
* using [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)
* [parsons problems](https://janke-learning.org/parsonizer/)
* language pieces:
    * (have your inspector open to run the examples!)
    * [JS fundamentals](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/JavaScript/tree/master/fundamentals)
    * [group quiz in class](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/JavaScript/blob/master/fundamentals/exercises.md)
* kick-off homework 
    * [errors](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework/blob/master/week-1/jl-errors-formatting.md)
    * [variables](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework/blob/master/week-1/jl-variables-swaps.md) 
    * [FCC basic JS](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework/blob/master/week-1/fcc-basic-js-pt-1.md)
    * [functions](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework/blob/master/week-1/jl-functions.md)

### projects launch off
* set your project forks live on GitHub Pages
* clone your forked repos using [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or [console](https://www.wikihow.com/Clone-a-Repository-on-Github)
* [using JS in HTML](https://javascript.info/hello-world)
* [using the chrome inspector](https://javascript.info/debugging-chrome)
* discuss [user stories](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/userStory.htm) & incremental development
* complete together the ```index.html``` for [this week's project](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-cross-module/tree/master/week-1)


### sendoff
* introduce [LearnGitBranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org)
* questions?

## Homework

> SLACK!  Many of you have been asking us very good questions over slack, and many of you are asking the same questions!  This week ask all of your questions in your class's channel and tag us.  If you don't we won't know to answer

### Homework Priority

* :seedling: : must finish
* :dash: : must start
* :fire: : challenge

### JS

Do not only write quick solutions to the exercises to pass them. **We want you to understand more than we want you to pass a lot of exercises**.
If you don't finish everything but have understood what you finished, that's just ok.  Just be sure to let us know in your homework PR!

Really understanding the code means you could do the same work that pythontutor does but drawing yourself on a paper. To help you get there, there are all the great tools listed in the main README for this module. 

* Go to your fork of the [JS 1 homework repo](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework) - follow the link to see assignment priorities


### Project

The goal of the project is to make it work __not__ to understand everything you do.  It's the opposite of the homework, hack it!

* :seedling: [cross-module project, week 1](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-cross-module/week-1)


### Git & GitHub
* :seedling: send a pull-request to [class-5 repo](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBEHomework/class-5/tree/master/bios) containing a short bio.
* :dash: [learn git branching: remote -> clone intro 1, 2, 3, 4](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
